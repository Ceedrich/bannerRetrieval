This is a simple server side mod that allows players to remove banner patterns
from their shields by using them on a cauldron.

## Features

- Adds the ability to remove banners from shields
- **WARNING**: After removing the banner from the shield, the banner will only
  have its original pattern and color. All other components like a custom name
  (in the case of the ominous banner its color) are lost!
